# ETCH A SKETCH

This was honestly a lot easier than I thought, now I just need to add ***style***... Uh, and a UI.

The big functionality deficiency at the moment is, currently, I'm removing the eventlistener when I don't want it. This means if you want to switch back and forth, you have to reload the page going from `!recolorable` to `recolorable`. Which sucks, because I put the effort into making the darkener (recolorable) properly affect colored pixels (!recolorable)!
